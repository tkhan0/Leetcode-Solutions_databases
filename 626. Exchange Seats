Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
Note:

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.


Solution:

select id, 
case 
when id%2 = 1 and ld_student is not null then ld_student
when id%2 = 1 and ld_student is null then student
when id%2 = 0 then lg_student
end as student from
(
select id, student, lead(student)over(order by id) as ld_student,
lag(student)over(order by id) as lg_student from seat
) sub
