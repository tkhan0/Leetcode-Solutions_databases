Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Solution :

select max(case when rnk = 2 then salary else null end) as SecondHighestSalary from 
 (
 select salary , dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as rnk from Employee 
 ) s
