Table: Terms

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| power       | int  |
| factor      | int  |
+-------------+------+
power is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one term of the equation.
power is an integer in the range [0, 100].
factor is an integer in the range [-100, 100] and cannot be zero.
 

You have a very powerful program that can solve any equation of one variable in the world. The equation passed to the program must be formatted as follows:

The left-hand side (LHS) should contain all the terms.
The right-hand side (RHS) should be zero.
Each term of the LHS should follow the format "<sign><fact>X^<pow>" where:
<sign> is either "+" or "-".
<fact> is the absolute value of the factor.
<pow> is the value of the power.
If the power is 1, do not add "^<pow>".
For example, if power = 1 and factor = 3, the term will be "+3X".
If the power is 0, add neither "X" nor "^<pow>".
For example, if power = 0 and factor = -3, the term will be "-3".
The powers in the LHS should be sorted in descending order.
Write an SQL query to build the equation.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Terms table:
+-------+--------+
| power | factor |
+-------+--------+
| 2     | 1      |
| 1     | -4     |
| 0     | 2      |
+-------+--------+
Output: 
+--------------+
| equation     |
+--------------+
| +1X^2-4X+2=0 |
+--------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Terms table:
+-------+--------+
| power | factor |
+-------+--------+
| 4     | -4     |
| 2     | 1      |
| 1     | -1     |
+-------+--------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| equation        |
+-----------------+
| -4X^4+1X^2-1X=0 |
+-----------------+



Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below


select concat(replace(group_concat(equation),',',''),'=0') as
equation from(
select rnk, case 
when power = 1 and factor > 0 then concat('+',factor,'X')
when power = 1 and factor < 0 then concat(factor,'X')
when power = 0 and factor > 0 then concat('+',factor)
when power = 0 and factor < 0 then factor
when power > 1 and factor >0 then concat('+',factor,'X^',power)
else concat(factor, 'X^', power)
end as equation
from(
select *, rank()over(order by power desc) as rnk from terms)sub)sub1
order by rnk desc
