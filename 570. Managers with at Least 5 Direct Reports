The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.


Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below


select 
    distinct name from
(
select 
        manager_name as name, 
        count(manager_name)over(partition by manager_name) cnt from
(
    select 
        a.id as employeeid, 
        a.name, a.department, 
        b.id,
        b.name as manager_name
    from employee a inner join employee b on
    a.managerid = b.id
)sub
    )sub1 
        where sub1.cnt >=5
