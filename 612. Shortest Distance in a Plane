Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
 

Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.


Solution:

select 
    min(distinct round(sqrt(power((b_x - a_x),2) + power((b_y - a_y),2)),2)) as shortest from
    (
        select 
            a.x as a_x, 
            a.y as a_y, 
            b.x as b_x, 
            b.y as b_y  
    from point_2d a cross join point_2d b 
            where a.x != b.x or a.y!= b.y)sub
