Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

The query result format is in the following example:

Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+


Solution:

select 
    distinct p.product_id, 
    ifnull(sub1.new_price,10) as price 
from
(
    select * from
(
    select *, 
            rank() over(partition by product_id order by change_date desc) as rnk
from 
    products where change_date <='2019-08-16')sub
where rnk = 1)sub1
    right join products p on
    sub1.product_id = p.product_id
